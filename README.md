# Automatic-image-captioning-with-CNN-and-LSTM
The Automatic Image Captioning with CNN and LSTM project is a deep learning application that generates meaningful textual descriptions for images by combining Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing techniques. The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract high-level visual features from images and feeds them into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to generate contextually accurate captions word by word. The model is trained on large image-caption datasets to learn the relationship between visual patterns and natural language sequences. It includes image preprocessing, feature extraction, tokenization, sequence padding, and model training with optimized loss functions. This project demonstrates strong understanding of deep learning architectures, sequence modeling, transfer learning, and the integration of vision and language models to build real-world AI applications.
